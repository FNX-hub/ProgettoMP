HEALTH DEVICE PROFILE (HDP) from Android 4.0 (API level 14) (COPY-PASTE FROM DEVELOPER)

This lets you create applications that use Bluetooth to communicate with health devices that support Bluetooth, such as heart-rate monitors, blood meters, thermometers, and scales. The Bluetooth Health API includes the classes BluetoothHealth, BluetoothHealthCallback, and BluetoothHealthAppConfiguration, which are described in Key Classes and Interfaces (see interface.txt).

In using the Bluetooth Health API, it's helpful to understand these key HDP concepts:

>	Source: a health device—such as a weight scale, glucose meter, or thermometer—that transmits medical data to a smart device.
>	Sink: the smart device that receives the medical data. In an Android HDP application, the sink is represented by a BluetoothHealthAppConfiguration object.
>	Registration: the process used to register a sink for communicating with a particular health device.
>	Connection: the process used to open a channel between a health device (source) and a smart device (sink).

HDP APPLICATION FOE DUMMIES

1>	Get a reference to the BluetoothHealth proxy object.
	Similar to regular headset and A2DP profile devices, you must call getProfileProxy() with a BluetoothProfile.ServiceListener and the HEALTH profile type to 		establish a connection with the profile proxy object.
2>	Create a BluetoothHealthCallback and register an application configuration (BluetoothHealthAppConfiguration) that acts as a health sink.
3>	Establish a connection to a health device.

NOTE: Some devices initiate the connection automatically. It is unnecessary to carry out this step for those devices.

When connected successfully to a health device, read/write to the health device using the file descriptor. The received data need to be interpreted using a health manager which implements the IEEE 11073 specifications. When done, close the health channel and unregister the application. The channel also closes when there is extended inactivity.
