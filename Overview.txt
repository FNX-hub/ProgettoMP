OVERVIEW (SELECT FROM DEVELOPER)

Using the Bluetooth APIs, an Android application can perform the following:

>	Scan for other Bluetooth devices
>	Query the local Bluetooth adapter for paired Bluetooth devices
>	Establish RFCOMM channels
>	Connect to other devices through service discovery
>	Transfer data to and from other devices
>	Manage multiple connections

PAIRING IN NUTSHELL (COPY-PASTE FROM DEVELOPER)

In order for Bluetooth-enabled devices to transmit data between each other, they must first form a channel of communication using a pairing process. One device, a discoverable device, makes itself available for incoming connection requests. Another device finds the discoverable device using a service discovery process. After the discoverable device accepts the pairing request, the two devices complete a bonding process where they exchange security keys.

The devices cache these keys for later use. After the pairing and bonding processes are complete, the two devices exchange information. When the session is complete, the device that initiated the pairing request releases the channel that had linked it to the discoverable device. The two devices remain bonded, however, so they can reconnect automatically during a future session as long as they're in range of each other and neither device has removed the bond.
