PERMISSIONS

Require 2 permisions:

>	BLUETOOTH: used to perform any Bluetooth comunication, such as requesting a connection, accepting a connection, and transferring data.
>	ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION: needed this permission because a Bluetooth scan can be used to gather information about the location of the user. This
	information may come from the user's own devices, as well as Bluetooth beacons in use at locations such as shops and transit facilities.

For initialize device discovery or manipulate Bluetoot setting:
>	BLUETOOTH_ADMIN: needed this permission solely for the ability to discover local Bluetooth devices.
	The other abilities granted by this permission should not be used, unless the application is a "power manager" that modifies Bluetooth settings upon user 	request.

From Android 8.0 (API LEVEL 26) can be usesed the CompanionDeviceManager to perform a scan of nearby companion devices on behalf of your app without requiring the location permission.
